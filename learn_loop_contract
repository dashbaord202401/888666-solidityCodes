//Loops allow you to iterate through data and take functional acton depending on the data
// A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code over a known number of times. 
//For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number

//For a demonstration here, let's write a function that loops through aan array or list of numbers, checking
//to see the multiples of 4 in that list, say from 1 - 10.

//through the entire length (represented by dot length in "numbersList.length") one by one, beginning or initializing from the first index i = "1"
 // so lomg as every "i" it touches on from 1 - 10 in the array is not more than (<) the length [10] of the list. 
 //And for each time we are done with an "i", we give the for loop the power to increment i (that is move on to the next index) through "i++"

//So, "for" from the beginning or initialized value in the array, once what is in the IF statement in the function "checkMultiplesValidity" is "true"
//then, the program goes below to apply the count increment (count(++) to make uint count = 1, which means the fucnton has found one digit a multiple of the input "4". 
//To move on to the next item in the list and lopp through it, the loop statement then goes back to increment "i++" to the next number in the array
